# Genetic Algorithm Optimized Support Vector Machine

## Introduction

This project is the Python implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is solved using conventional Platt SMO and Genetic Algorithm (GA), respectively.

The SVM in this project is used to solve a 2-dimensional linear classification problem. Source data to be classified was generated randomly, as shown below:
